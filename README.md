# Power-BI-Product-Sales-Dashboard

In this project I built a condensed, dynamic, performance report based on the product sales dataset which utilises SWITCH measures and conditional formatting.

# Project Structure

1. First the data from Excel is brought into Power Query while making necessary changes to the data and creating virtual tables.\
2. Then the model is set up by building DAX measures and calculated columns where necessary.\
3. Then the dashboard is created by building a layout and design.
